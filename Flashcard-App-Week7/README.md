## Lab 4

### App Description
For week 7 of the Codepath Android Course, the previous flashcard app was modified. Animations were added to the app. As well as some styling. The background color of the app was changed to a light blue. Also, three animations were added: a transition animation when going from the main screen to the add card screen, a reveal animation when the flashcard is tapped and the answer is shown, and flashcards animating in / out when the 'next' button is tapped.
